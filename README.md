## RTL CSS Project

A simple project to convert LTR CSS to RTL and serve the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.

### Setting up and running the project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd poc_rtlcss
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Build CSS and HTML:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This generates the dist folder with LTR and RTL CSS and updates the HTML if needed.
5. Run the Project:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
